<h2 style="bold;" align="center">Hello, and welcome to my repo! üëã</h2>

üñ•Ô∏è I have had a fondness for technology and computers since I was around two years old. I would watch my dad use the computer, and in time, I was in his shoes. While he wasn't a computer scientist, my daily usage of computers and eventual plunge into the curiosity of how a computer works led me to major in computer science at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. Go Spartans!

üìë I currently research topics in artificial intelligence with a focus on rhetoric and education with [Dr. Nancy L. Green](https://www.uncg.edu/cmp/faculty/nlgreen/). We have implemented a project SWED/AIED (Software Engineering/Artificial Intelligence Ethics Debater) allowing students to build and analyze arguments, case studies, and ethical studies via a graphical interface with trees. Our recent research discusses the challenges with detecting rhetorical devices in scientific policy articles [(Automatic Detection of Rhetorical Devices in Science Policy Articles)](https://joshuacrotts.us/assets/2020-Research.pdf) and literature. The most recent paper and work discusses the difficulty of  automatically detecting antithesis, or contrasting ideas in a sentence.

üéì In addition to the rhetorical, artificial intelligence-based work, I also have a fondness for computer science education. I will get my Master's at UNCG in Spring 2022, with a Ph. D. contingent on funding and availability of the in-progress program. With this in mind, I work as a tutor and TA for intro to computer science (CSC-130) courses, gaining invaluable experience. 

üéÆ Other relevant interests are high-performance and parallel computing/processing, embedded software engineering, compiler design, low-level programming (e.g. systems programming), operating systems, and video game design (hence why my major projects are either games or game engines in C and Java!). 

üìì My theoretical computer science interests are in formal (prepositional/predicate/modal) logic, higher-order logic, theory of computation, and algorithm analysis and design with a focus in computer graphics and compression. My graduate algorithm analysis paper, [Binary Space Partitioning - A Focus on Rendering and Compression Algorithms](https://joshuacrotts.us/assets/bsppaper.pdf), where I analyze various methods of compressing graphics with spatial partitioning was of my first introductions to writing a paper of this higher-education caliber.
